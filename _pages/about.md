I am a Research Engineer at [NVIDIA, Toronto AI Lab](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} and a Ph.D. student at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/), advised by [Prof. Sanja Fidler](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/) and [Dr. Masha Shugrina](https://shumash.com/research). I am also affiliated with [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

Previously in my career I worked as an Applied Scientist at [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/){:target="\_blank"}, as a Research Engineer at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/){:target="\_blank"} and as a System Architect and Software Engineer at [Ofek, IAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofek_unit){:target="\_blank"}. I've obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Sciences from Tel Aviv University, under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Cohen-Or](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/index.html){:target="\_blank"}. I am also a [Mamram](https://www.mamram.tech/){:target="\_blank"} Alumni.

My research lies at the convergence of computer vision, graphics, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in AI-driven 3D simulations, including realistic reconstructions and interactive workflows for manipulating them.
